# Run

In this game, the character (user) moves forward automatically, and the player's primary objective is to control its movements to avoid obstacles and hazards. In this game, I programmed the user to avoid mushrooms, while traversing through rough terraings. The user can press the space bar to reverse gravity and traverse along the top floor of the terrain.
